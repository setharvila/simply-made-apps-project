# The Brief:

In this project, you will create functionality so that the user can select a date and time from a picker and the app will report if that date/time is within the given office hours.

You will create an `OfficeHours` class. It should have three fields:
* `daysOfWeek`, which will be an array of integers
* `startTime`, which will be a string
* `endTime`, which will be a string

The days of the week would indicate which days of the week office hours are held. The start time and end time indicate what period the office hours are held on those given days.

### Example:
An office hours object with `daysOfWeek` of [1,3,4], a `startTime` of “11:00” and an `endTime` of “14:00” would mean the office hours are Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 11:00 AM until 2:00 PM each week.

### Note:
The code provided will not compile as is.  You should be able to fix that.  Please do not give us back code that won't compile.

We've given you a few files to start with, and we have left `TODO`s in the code that should highlight where we'd like changes made.

### Best of luck!
